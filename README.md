Database Management System

- practice in MySQL on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Linux 64-bit)



1. databass.sql

Copy and paste CREATE and INSERT block to sqlfiddle.com, and then build.
You can query to right side of window.
(I made some SELECT query below the INSERT block...)
View DESC {table_name} to check its structure!
